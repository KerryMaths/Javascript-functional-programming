## Working through Functors by [Mattias Petter Johansson](https://github.com/mpj/)

## Functors
- Functors are objects that have a map method
- Eg: Array is a functor because it has an implementation of map
- Other examples, promises, streams
- It then unwraps the value into its components (in the case of an array) and passes it to the function
- And returns value in structured form.
